
## Summary

A digital tape player for vintage computers

## Description

The TZXDuino is an open-source device used to play digital recordings of cassette tapes on retro computers like the ZX80, ZX81, ZX-Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. The TZXduino-mini places an ATmega328 processor directly on the PCB rather than using an Arduino Nano.

## Firmware

The TZXduini-mini is firmware compatible with earlier versions of the TZXduino. There are many forks of the TZXduino firmware. I used the one from arduitape.blogspot.com. There are also forks of the firmware on GitHub. Choose whichever one you like.
